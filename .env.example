# Gmail API credentials for production
# Copy the contents of python_script/credentials.json and python_script/token.json
# and paste them as single-line JSON strings (minified)

GMAIL_CREDENTIALS={"installed":{"client_id":"...","client_secret":"...","redirect_uris":["..."]}}
GMAIL_TOKEN={"token":"...","refresh_token":"...","token_uri":"...","client_id":"...","client_secret":"...","scopes":["..."],"expiry":"..."}

# How to set these up:
# 1. Run the Python script locally first to generate credentials.json and token.json
# 2. Copy the content of credentials.json and minify it (remove all newlines/spaces)
# 3. Set GMAIL_CREDENTIALS to that minified JSON string
# 4. Do the same for token.json and set GMAIL_TOKEN
# 5. Add these to your Vercel environment variables
